\section{Introduction and Motivation}
Bridge Inspection Projection consists of building model of bridges using a UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) to provide for more streamlined inspection. Bridges require a biennial inspection and the present state of inspection involves manual surveying which is time consuming and involves cumbersome paper-based storage.

\section{Error Analysis of Point Clouds}
    In this section we shall go through techniques of analyzing error metrics between two given point clouds. The error metric would be a function of the distances between corresponding points.
